A JavaEE project for implementing servlets and database configurations

In an attempt to learn what is JavaEE and servlet designs and db configuration, I built up this app to start imagining its usefullness.
As a result, a basic app with almost nothing but still great colors was developed within few hours.

This app also uses database named "IFA" in MySQL v5.5

The files related to database schema are saved in file named 'database'.
